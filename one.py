# Today's Coding Challenge:
# Print out each element of the following array on a separate line
my_list = ["Joe", "2", "Ted", "4.98", "14", "Sam", "void *", "42", "float", "pointers", "5006"]
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.
# Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code.

for x in my_list:
  print(x)
